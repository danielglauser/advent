# advent

Some of the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) exercises written in Clojure.

## Usage

Just run `lein test` to execute the code against the test cases or
fire it up in your REPL of choice and execute the functions
individually. The functions were written so you can easily copy/paste
the input with no transformations from the [Advent of
Code](http://adventofcode.com/) site directly into strings in the REPL
and execute the functions.
